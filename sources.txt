                basic examples of library usage, 
                    - that which is required to gain familiarity with the tools available 
                tracking down errors that are hard to spot (either due to unfamilarity or limited attention span)
                advanced library usage
                    - like extending classes to allow capturing of information available only at specific contexts 
                    - that which required to gain fluency with the tools available    
                more efficient ways to structure code
            }

        About python units using pytest library 
        Issues using Jenkins like how to structure a pipeline script and unicode
